False,E Hall | Lobby,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers UW Madison,PID Arm,"An inverted pendulum is a system with a free swinging weight where its center of mass is located above its pivot point. When the center of mass is not aligned directly above the pivot point, the system is unstable where the weight can fall over at any time. However, it can be stabilized through a PID controlled feedback loop. Using a rotary encoder to measure the angle of the pivot, we can counteract the falling inertia of the weight by rapidly pulling the pivot towards the direction of its fall in order to recenter its center of mass above the pivot point. By restricting the pivotâs degree of freedom to a linear v-slot aluminum rail, we can pull the entire system on a cart using a motorized belt assembly. The whole system will be controlled by a raspberry pi microcontroller."
